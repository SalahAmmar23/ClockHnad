# ‚è∞ Digital Clock Simulation (Java)

This project simulates a 24-hour digital clock using Java. It demonstrates key object-oriented programming concepts, such as **encapsulation** and **composition**.

---

## üìÇ Files

- **`Main.java`**: This file runs the clock simulation by creating a `Clock` object. It continuously advances the clock every second, printing the time in `HH:MM:SS` format.
  
- **`Clock.java`**: This class handles the logic of the digital clock. It manages three components ‚Äî hours, minutes, and seconds ‚Äî and advances them appropriately when their limits are reached.

- **`ClockHand.java`**: This class represents a single hand of the clock (e.g., hours, minutes, or seconds). It handles advancing the hand by one unit, and it resets when the limit (like 60 seconds or 24 hours) is reached.

## üß™ Concepts Demonstrated

- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**: The project uses classes and objects to represent the clock and its components.
- **Encapsulation**: Each part of the clock (hours, minutes, seconds) is encapsulated in its own class, hiding the internal workings.
- **Composition**: The `Clock` class is composed of `ClockHand` objects to represent hours, minutes, and seconds.
- **Time Simulation**: The program simulates the ticking of a clock, advancing the time with logic for rolling over after reaching the limit (e.g., 60 seconds to 0).
- **Output Formatting**: The time is displayed in a consistent `HH:MM:SS` format.
